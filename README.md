# Final-Project
# A Bucket In a Raining Day

This final project is included sound effect, loops and variations that we have learn so far into one piece. 

## Summary

I am building a gray background with raining effect with the sound of the rain. 
Under the rain, there's a bucket which can be filled by the water, and there is also a 
gray wooden pole on the left side. The mouse is interactive with the bucket, you can 
drag the bucket horizontally. Additionally, you can drag the bucket under the wood pole,
where the rain stops, and the bucket stops filling the water.  If the bucket is full, you
can click onto the bucket to empty the water.  



## Component Parts

There are four major parts: the sound, the rain, the bucket and the interaction with the mouse.

For the sound, I downloaded a rain effect mp3 into my computer. 
For the rain and the bucket variables I have set up with: 
var rain = [];
var bucket_height = 400;
var bucket_x=0;
var bucket_y=600;
var bucket_full = 0;
To start with, so when I put the data in, I just need to plug the number in. 


## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Figuring out all the variables and components I needed 
- Week 2: Putting the background, rain effect, wooden pole and bucket onto the canvas
- Week 3: Interaction part: adding the sound, deleting the rain when it hits the wooden
pole and bucket, filling the bucket with water and delete the water with mouse. 
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

One of the challenges was over complicating the rain effect and another 
challenge was think of way to build up the water in the bucket by 
calculating the quad shape.
